# NLH: A Blind Pixel-level Non-local Method for Real-world Image Denoising
This repository is for NLH introduced in the following paper

Yingkun Hou, Jun Xu, Mingxia Liu, Guanghai Liu, Li Liu, Fan Zhu, and Ling Shao, "NLH: A Blind Pixel-level Non-local 
Method for Real-world Image Denoising", IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Accepted,doi: 10.1109/TIP.2020.2980116.

The code is built on Matlab 2018a.

The folder NLH_AWGN_Gray includes gray scale images Additive Gaussian White Noise denosing codes and some gray scale images.

The rest codes and images are related to real world images denoising.
