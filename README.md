### method for Real-world Image Denoising", IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 29, pp. 5121-5135, 2020.

* The code is built on Matlab 2018a.

* The folder `NLH_AWGN_Gray` includes gray scale images Additive Gaussian White Noise denosing codes and some gray scale images.

* The folder `NLH_CC` includes CC dataset and denoising codes. The related information refers to "S. Nam, Y. Hwang, Y.  Matsushita, and S. J. Kim. A holistic approach to cross-channel image noise modeling and its application to image
denoising. In CVPR, pages 1683–1691, 2016."

* The folder `NLH_DND` only includes denoising codes for DND dataset, the dataset can be download from the following website:     https://noise.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/. The related information refers to "T.  Plo¨tz  and  S.  Roth.   Bench                                 algorithms  with  real photographs.  In CVPR, 2017."
